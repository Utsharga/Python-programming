    "## Background\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "This assignment deals with interpreting a table of weather simulation data, to predict the daily weather. Say that when a weather simulation program runs, it creates a row of output in the form of a Python list:\n",
    "\n",
    "    row = [hour, temperature, relHumidity, [cloudCover, cloudHeight], [windSpdLow, windSpdHigh]]\n",
    "\n",
    "where `hour` is an integer between 0 and 23 representing hours past midnight, `temperature` is a float in Celsius, `relHumidity` and `cloudCover` are percents (floats) between 0 and 1, `cloudHeight` is an integer in metres, and both `windSpdLow` and `windSpdHigh` are floats in km/h.\n",
    "The simulation runs $n$ times, and returns the final result as a list of rows:\n",
    "\n",
    "                                    data = [ row_1, row_2, ..., row_n ]\n",
    "                                    \n",
    "Your program will contain a set of functions that can be used to interpret this list of simulation rows.\n",
    "                                    \n",
    "Design, implement, and test a program that satisfies the requirements below.\n",
    "\n",
    "-------------------\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "1. Implement the function `isTempBetween(row, minTemp, maxTemp)`, which takes ONE ROW of a weather simulation (`[hour, temp, etc.]`) and two floats `minTemp` and `maxTemp`, and returns `True` if `temperature` for that row is between `minTemp` and `maxTemp`, `False` otherwise.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Implement the function `isHumidityOver(row, percent)`, which takes ONE ROW of a weather simulation (`[hour, temp, etc.]`) and a float `percent`, and returns `True` if `relHumidity` for that row is above `percent`, `False` otherwise. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Implement the function `isWindSpeedOver(row, speed)`, which takes ONE ROW of a weather simulation (`[hour, temp, etc.]`) and a float `speed`, and returns `True` if `windSpdLow` for that row is above `speed`, `False` otherwise.<br><br> \n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Implement the function `hailChance(data)`, which takes a list of weather simulation rows (`[row1, row2, etc.]`), and returns the list `[chance, time]`. <br>`chance` is a float between 0 and 1 representing the chance that hail will occur, and `time` is a float defined as the range of time hail could be present: \n",
    "$$chance = \\frac{Number\\hspace{0.15cm}of\\hspace{0.15cm}rows\\hspace{0.15cm}in\\hspace{0.15cm}data\\hspace{0.15cm}that\\hspace{0.15cm}indicate\\hspace{0.15cm}hail}{Total\\hspace{0.15cm}number\\hspace{0.15cm}of\\hspace{0.15cm}rows\\hspace{0.15cm}in\\hspace{0.15cm}data}$$ \n",

    "\n",
    "`NOTE:` If no rows of `data` indicate hail, then `time` should be equal to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The program requires very little besides the function definitions. There is no main().<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Your name, MacID, student number, and the date are given in comments at the top of the first Python cell below.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Your answers to the design questions and test plan are given in the appropriate Markdown cells below.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Your program MUST have valid Python syntax and it must run without errors. Ensure that your program runs properly by running it before you submit.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "9. You must sign out with a TA or IAI after you have submitted your lab at the submission station. Failure to do so could result in a mark of zero.\n",
    "------------------\n",
    "## Design and Implementation Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You may assume that inputs will be within a valid range and of the correct type, and that exception handling is not necessary.<br><br>\n",
    "2. Follow the function syntax **EXACTLY** as given, including spelling, capitalization and the order of function paramaters.\n",
