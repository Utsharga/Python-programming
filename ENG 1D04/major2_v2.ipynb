    "## Background\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "This assignment is motivated by scientific and engineering applications that analyze \n",
    "experimental data.  The purpose of this assignment is to write a Python program that reads\n",
    "two sequences of numbers stored in two separate files, represents the sequences of\n",
    "numbers as two lists of floats, performs a calculation on the members of\n",
    "the lists, and then outputs the result.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Design, implement, and test a program that satisfies the requirements below.\n",
    "\n",
    "-------------------\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "1. The program starts with two text files defined for you below that will be used in your program. The first file is a file $F_x$ containing a (finite) sequence $x_0, x_1, \\ldots, x_{n-1}$ of numbers, where each number represents the $x_i$ member of the sequence, in order.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The program reads in the values in $F_x$ and constructs a list $L_x$ of floats representing the sequence.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The program repeats the previous two requirements for a second file $F_y$ containing the corresponding $y_0, y_1, \\ldots, y_{n-1}$ values, and constructs a list $L_y$ of floats.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The program computes the slope $m$ of the best fit line to the data. The program returns $m$, $L_x$ and $L_y$ as output. The equation for \n",
    "determining $m$ for the $n$ data points in the input files is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "### <center>$m = \\frac {n [ \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} x_i y_i ] + [\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} x_i] [\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} y_i]}{n[\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} x_i^2] + ([\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} x_i])^2}$</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation looks harder to calculate than it actually is.  To follow a systematic approach to its\n",
    "implementation, start by answering the design question given below.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Your name, MacID, student number, and the date are given in comments at the top of the first Python cell below.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Your answers to the design questions and test plan are given in the appropriate Markdown cells below.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Your program MUST have valid Python syntax and it must run without errors. Ensure that your program runs properly by running it before you submit.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "8. You must sign out with a TA or IAI after you have submitted your lab at the submission station. Failure to do so could result in a mark of zero.\n",
    "------------------\n",
    "## Design and Implementation Instructions\n",
    "You may assume without penalty that there is exactly one number per line in the files $F_x$ and $F_y$ and that both files are the same length.\n",
    "\n",
