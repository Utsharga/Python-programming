    "## Background\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "In this assignment you will implement a library of functions that can be used to draw a histogram (bar graph) in ASCII art style. Your library will create a *list* of strings that, when printed appropriately, form a histogram of a list of data points, and is made of a given character. For example, if every element of the list *[3, 2, 4]* using the string character **`#`** is printed, this would be the result:\n",
    "\n",
    "                                                ### \n",
    "                                                ##  \n",
    "                                                ####\n",
    "The *returned list* for this histogram should look like this:\n",
    "<center>[\"###&nbsp;\", \"##&nbsp;&nbsp;\", \"####\"] </center>\n",
    "Notice that the strings in this list are padded by space characters on the right so that all the strings will be of equal length. This length is determined by the greatest value in the list to be plotted. In the example above, the length of the strings in the list is 4. When this histogram is flipped horizontally and printed `element by element,` the following results:\n",
    "                                                 ###\n",
    "                                                  ##\n",
    "                                                ####\n",
    "The *returned list* for this histogram should look like this:\n",
    "<center>[\" ###\", \"&nbsp;&nbsp;##\", \"####\"] </center>\n",
    "Design, implement, and test a program that satisfies the requirements below.\n",
    "\n",
    "-------------------\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "1.  Implement **makeRow(w, m, c)** which returns the rows for the *unflipped* histogram by doing the following:<br><br>\n",
    "    - Takes the integers **w** and **m** and a single string character **c**.\n",
    "    - Returns a string composed of **w * c** and enough spaces on the right to reach a total length of **m**.<br><br>\n",
    "2.  Implement **histogram(a, c)** which returns the *unflipped* histogram by doing the following: <br><br>\n",
    "    - Takes in the list of integers **a** and a single string character **c**.\n",
    "    - Uses **makeRow** to create a list of strings that forms an unflipped histogram with the single string character **c** and the elements in the list **a**.\n",
    "    - Returns the list of strings that forms the unflipped histogram.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Implement **flipHist(a, c)** which returns the *flipped* histogram by doing the following:<br><br>\n",
    "    - Takes in the list of integers **a** and a single string character **c**.\n",
    "    - Uses **histogram** to create an *unflipped* histogram with **a** and **c** \n",
    "    - Returns the list of strings that forms the flipped histogram.<br><br>\n",
    "4. The program requires very little besides the function definitions. There is no main().<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Your name, MacID, student number, and the date are given in comments at the top of the first Python cell below.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Your answers to the design questions and test plan are given in the appropriate Markdown cells below.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Your program MUST have valid Python syntax and it must run without errors. Ensure that your program runs properly by running it before you submit.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "8. You must sign out with a TA or IAI after you have submitted your lab at the submission station. Failure to do so could result in a mark of zero.\n",
    "------------------\n",
    "## Design and Implementation Instructions\n",
    "1. Conditional statements are not needed for this program.<br><br>\n",
    "2. You may assume that inputs will be within a valid range and of the correct type, and that exception handling is not necessary.<br><br>\n",
    "3. Follow the function syntax **EXACTLY** as given, including spelling, capitalization and the order of function paramaters.<br><br>\n",
    "4. You may choose to use ' '.join(list) to concatenate a list into a single string.\n",
    "\n",
